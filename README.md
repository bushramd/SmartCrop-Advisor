# SmartCrop-Advisor

## 🌱 SmartCrop Advisor – IoT Based Smart Agriculture System

## 📌 Project Description

SmartCrop Advisor is an IoT-based agricultural monitoring system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions.

The system collects real-time soil and environmental parameters such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Soil Moisture
- pH Level
- NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)

Based on the collected data, the system analyzes soil health and predicts suitable crops and recommended pesticides.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on traditional methods and assumptions to select crops and fertilizers. Lack of accurate soil data leads to:

- Poor crop selection
- Overuse or underuse of fertilizers
- Reduced crop yield
- Increased farming costs
- Soil degradation over time

There is a need for an affordable, real-time, and easy-to-use smart system.
