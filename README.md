# SmartCrop-Advisor
IOT-based Smart Crop Advisor using soil and environmental sensors
🌱 SmartCrop Advisor – IoT Based Smart Agriculture System
📌 Project Description
 SmartCrop Advisor is an IoT-based agricultural monitoring system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions. 
 The system collects real-time soil and environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH level, and NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) values using multiple sensors connected to an Arduino Uno.
 Based on the collected data, the system analyzes soil health and predicts suitable crops and recommended pesticides. 
 This helps improve crop yield, reduce resource wastage, and promote smart farming practices.
❗ Problem Statement
Farmers often rely on traditional methods and assumptions to select crops and fertilizers. Lack of accurate soil data leads to:
Poor crop selection
    Overuse or underuse of fertilizers
    Reduced crop yield
    Increased farming costs
    Soil degradation over time
There is a need for an affordable, real-time, and easy-to-use smart system that can monitor soil conditions and guide farmers in choosing the right crop and pesticides.
💡 Proposed Solution
SmartCrop Advisor solves this problem by:
Collecting real-time soil and environmental data using IoT sensors
